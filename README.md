### **Summary:**
This Streamlit app demonstrates text emotion classification by leveraging a pre-trained deep learning model. Users input text, and the app processes this input to predict the emotion using a tokenizer and a neural network model. The results are displayed interactively, providing a user-friendly interface for emotion analysis.

### **Conclusion:**
The app successfully integrates machine learning with a web interface, offering an intuitive way to classify emotions in text. This example is an excellent starting point for beginners to understand how machine learning models can be deployed in real-world applications using Streamlit.
